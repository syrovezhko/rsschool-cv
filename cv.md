### About Me
I'm 28 years old, mechanical aerospace design engineer, computer science teacher, student's mentor. 

I've choosed that way because I have wanted to help people. It's started like aircraft engineering since studen's: design engineering departments in satelites and aircraft corporations, internatinoal NASA exhange program ets. In 2017 led to inviting me to —Åhildren's art centre in part time robotics tacher role. I was loved it and the next summer I've resigned as engineer, and began teaching  robotics and computer science full time.
