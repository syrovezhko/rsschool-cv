### About Me

In 2017 led to inviting me to —Åhildren's art centre in part time robotics tacher role. I was loved it and the next summer I've resigned as engineer, and began teaching  robotics and computer science full time. Next 4 years I've demonstrated good results had expressed by my students competition achievement and their winned the gold medals.  However, in COVID-19 locdown I've understud, it's time to go to the next leve. I've introdused students the tech and information worlds. It's time to checout the IT by myself.
